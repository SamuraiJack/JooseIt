Joose 3
------

Joose 3 is currently under very active development. It is already stable with about 800 unit tests, though it may miss some features, 
presented in Joose 2 (like type system, serialization and some features for attributes). 

On top of the Joose 2 feature set Joose 3 offers a more to-the-spec implementation of roles based on 
[original traits spec](http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Research/Traits/), improved namespaces, better meta-roles support and [mutability](http://openjsan.org/go/?l=Joose.Manual.Mutability).

Joose 3 supports all modern browsers (including IE6) and the [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) platform. 

Joose 3 is being distributed via the "npm" package manager and the OpenJSAN platform.
