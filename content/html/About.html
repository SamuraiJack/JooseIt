<p>Joose 3 is currently under very active development. It is already stable with about 800 unit tests, though it may miss some features, 
presented in Joose 2 (like type system, serialization and some features for attributes). </p>

<p>On top of the Joose 2 feature set Joose 3 offers a more to-the-spec implementation of roles based on 
<a href="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Research/Traits/">original traits spec</a>, improved namespaces, better meta-roles support and <a href="http://joose.github.com/Joose/doc/html/Joose/Manual/Mutability.html">mutability</a>.</p>

<p>Joose 3 supports all modern browsers (including IE6) and the <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> platform. </p>

<p>Joose 3 is being distributed via the "npm" package manager and the OpenJSAN platform.</p>
