<h1 id="whatisjoose">WHAT IS Joose?</h1>

<p>Joose is a complete object system for JavaScript. Consider any modern object-oriented language. 
It provides keywords for attribute declaration, object construction, inheritance, and maybe more. These keywords are part of the language, and you don't care how they are implemented.</p>

<p>Joose aims to do the same thing for JavaScript. We can't actually create new keywords, but we do offer "sugar" that looks a lot like them. More importantly, with Joose, you define your class declaratively, 
without needing to know about prototype chains, etc.</p>

<p>With Joose, you can concentrate on the logical structure of your classes, focusing on "what" rather than "how". A class definition with Joose reads like a list of very concise English sentences.</p>

<p>Joose provides complete introspection for all Joose-using classes. This means you can ask classes about their attributes, parents, children, methods, etc., all using a well-defined API.</p>

<p>Joose is based in large part on the [Moose][1] system, which in turn borrows a lot of from Perl 6 object system, as well as drawing on the best ideas from CLOS, Smalltalk, and many other languages.</p>

<h1 id="whatisntjoose">WHAT ISN'T Joose?</h1>

<p>Joose isn't a new language or sources preprocessor. The code written in Joose, executes like regular JavaScript, and can be run in any modern JavaScript engine.</p>

<h1 id="whyjoose">WHY Joose?</h1>

<p>Joose makes JavaScript OO both simpler and more powerful. It encapsulates JavaScript power tools in high-level declarative APIs which are easy to use. 
Best of all, you don't need to be a wizard to use it. </p>

<p>But if you want to dig about in the guts, Joose lets you do that too, by using and extending its powerful introspection API.</p>
